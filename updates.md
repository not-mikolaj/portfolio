### Updating the Career Path

The career path timeline is designed to be easy to update and maintain. To add or modify career items:

1. Open `script.js`
2. Find the `careerPath` array near the top of the file
3. Edit, add, or remove career objects as needed
4. Each career object requires the following properties:
   - `date`: The timeframe (e.g., "2019 - 2022")
   - `title`: Your job title
   - `organization`: Company or organization name
   - `description`: Brief description of your role
   - `achievements`: Array of key achievements (bullet points)
   - `skills`: Array of skills/technologies used
